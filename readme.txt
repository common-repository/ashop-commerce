AShop Commerce hooks your WordPress up with an AShop shopping cart.

== Description ==

AShop Commerce lets you use an AShop shopping cart from WordPress to publish information from
the AShop database in WordPress posts, pages or sidebars.

A copy of the ecommerce software AShop from [AShop Software](http://www.ashopsoftware.com) is required to use this plugin.

Provides widgets for product categories, top sellers, latest additions, shopping mall shops and autoresponder signup.
Also gives you a set of shortcodes that can be used to publish information about products anywhere
in your posts or pages, for example to show the thumbnail image, the name or the price of a product.

If you store your AShop admin panel login in your WordPress user profile, you will be able to quickly
login from a menu item in the WordPress admin panel.

This plugin overrides the user registration in WordPress to automatically register new users as
customers in AShop as well. Because of this, it will most likely not work well with other plugins
that customize the registration process.

== Installation ==

Upload the AShop plugin to your blog and Activate it, then enter the database connetion details for
your AShop database on the configuration screen for the plugin.

== Screenshots ==
